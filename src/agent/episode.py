# Why this file exists (2026-09-23 fix)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before this fix, `run_case.py` set `affected_txn_ids = [flagged_txn_id]`,
# `first_suspicious_txn_id = flagged_txn_id`, and `exposure_usd =
# flagged_amount` UNCONDITIONALLY -- the flagged transaction is where the
# ALERT fired, not necessarily where the fraud started or how far it goes
# (README: "The flagged transaction is where the alert fired. It is not
# necessarily where the fraud started"). This module builds the actual
# "episode" -- the set of transactions on this card that plausibly belong to
# the same suspicious activity -- deterministically, from `card_window`'s own
# evidence, so the LLM's job becomes narrating/classifying a real episode
# instead of the pipeline silently reporting "just the one flagged row"
# regardless of what actually happened around it.
#
# These are heuristics, not ground truth (there is no fraud label in this
# dataset -- see README). They're deliberately conservative and explainable:
# every inclusion rule below is checked directly against real card_window
# data, not fit to any hidden target. Evidence claims built from this module
# should say so plainly, per the README's own instruction to "be honest in
# your evidence about what a column is."

    actually checked `channel` -- ANY nearby transaction counted, including
    in_person ones, which cannot be part of a card-NOT-present pattern by
    definition (README patterns 2/3 are explicitly about online use). 14 of
    20 real cases fired this "burst" as a result, and the deterministic
    override then force-labeled all of them card_not_present_fraud/
    card_not_present_new_device -- a major contributor to a batch that came
    back 20/20 fraud with none legitimate, against the README's own
    expectation of roughly half legitimate.

    If the FLAGGED transaction itself isn't online, this pattern cannot
    apply at all (there is nothing "card-not-present" about an in-person
    alert), so this returns just the flagged transaction with no burst.

    """True when the flagged transaction's billing region (`addr1`) differs

    README: "Card-present purchases in a billing region the cardholder has
    no history in, while their normal activity continues at home." A card
    that has fully MOVED region (no concurrent home activity) is not this
    pattern -- it's just a life event or a data artifact, not fraud here.

    Bug fix (2026-09-24), found live: the original version compared against
    the MAJORITY region across the card's ENTIRE history (since card_window
    now returns up to ~400 days of it -- see graph_flow.py's
    CARD_WINDOW_LOOKBACK_HOURS), with no time bound at all, despite this
    docstring already describing "concurrent" activity. Confirmed live on
    the real case pack: this fired on 8 of 20 cases and was the single
    biggest contributor to a batch where zero cases came back "legitimate"
    (README explicitly expects about half to be). A billing region that
    simply happened to differ from the lifetime-majority region eight
    months ago is not evidence of anything -- addr1 varies for ordinary
    reasons over a year of activity. Restricting the comparison to a
    genuinely concurrent window is what actually distinguishes "a trip"
    (this pattern's own stated non-example) from a real compromise.

    Second bug fix (2026-09-24), same diagnostic run: this function never
    required the flagged transaction to be CARD-PRESENT (`channel ==
    "in_person"`), even though the README defines this pattern explicitly
    as "Card-present purchases in a billing region..." -- an online
    purchase's billing address says nothing about where the cardholder
    physically was, so it can't evidence this pattern at all. Confirmed
    live: 6 of 20 real cases fired this signal for an ONLINE flagged
    transaction, and the deterministic override force-labeled all six
    out_of_region_use. Combined with the CNP-burst bug above, these two
    signals alone covered all 20 cases, leaving no room for the LLM to ever
    reach "none."
