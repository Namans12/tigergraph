# Task 8.5 empirically confirmed (live, independently verified twice) that the

# (4,665/5,565) -- analysts only open a case when there's real cause, so most
# closed cases confirm fraud REGARDLESS of whether the card is in a genuine
# coordinated ring. A 0.5 threshold is therefore nearly meaningless: it clears
# for almost any cluster with closed-case representation, including a verified
# 3,565-card supercluster (26% of all cards) sitting at 0.847 -- indistinguishable
# from baseline noise, not a real ring signal. 0.95 is chosen to sit clearly
# above that baseline, so only clusters with a materially higher confirmed-fraud
# concentration than "cases get investigated at all" trip this flag.

# against a small cluster hitting rate=1.0 off a single closed case (observed

# (Task 4) and Task 8.5's cluster_fraud_rate query only persist the RATIO, not
# the underlying case count, onto each Card. Adding that would mean reopening
# Task 8.5 (already complete and reviewed) for a new schema attribute, which
# isn't warranted given the 0.5->0.95 fix already addresses the dominant,
# confirmed problem. Documented here as a known limitation, not silently

# manual checkpoint) that is noise, not a real ring signal -- the exact same failure
# mode `coordinated`'s 0.5->0.95 threshold above exists to filter out for the sibling
# `shared_region` signal, but `shared_device` had no analogous guard at all (a bare
# `bool(neighbors)`), so it counted a 299-way collision as identically strong evidence
# to a real 2-3 card ring. Mirrors Task 8.5's own `SHARES_ORIGIN` edge-building
# precedent, which already caps/excludes buckets over 20 members from contributing an
# edge at all ("cap=20", task-8.5-report.md) -- reused verbatim here rather than
# inventing a new number, since this dataset's genuine small-scale device sharing and

    Confirmed live: 18 of the 20 batch cases carried a "cluster ... prior
    confirmed-fraud rate of 0.85" claim (17 of them citing that exact same
    supercluster), presented to the LLM with no indication it's noise --
    which is very plausibly why every single case in that run scored
    fraud_probability >= 0.55 and none came back "legitimate", despite the
    README's own expectation that about half the case pack should. A
    number below the coordinated threshold is not weak evidence of a ring;
    it is evidence AGAINST one (this card looks like every other card), so
    it's redacted here rather than shown with a caveat a small model might
    still latch onto.
